# Multi-Device-Authentication of Users based on Heart-Rate Monitoring Data
The problem statement of the project is Given a dataset of 5 participants that comprises of Heart Rate in BPM and Respiratory Rate interval measured in milliseconds which is collected from three devices namely Polar Heart Rate Monitor,Garmin-HRM Dual and VIVO ,the aim of the project is to confirm whether the three devices are being worn by the same user at any instant of time.<br>
This will be done based on the Heart-Rate data collected from the device that has been mentioned above by the help of analysis based on RR intervals and Heart Rate Variability.At first, features extraction will be done which will lead to correlating the features obtained.Correlation will be done in both ways of aligning and Non-aligning Windows.Later,False Acceptance Rate and False Rejection Rate will be computed which will give Equal Error Rate at the end to determine the threshold value.
